            My name is Stefano, my highest educational degree is a Master Degree in Computer Science with major in
artificial intelligence.<br/>
I’ve been working from 2014. In this years I’ve specialized in several fields and mainly as Fullstack Software
engineer. <br/>
I took my MSc degree while working and this gave me the oppurtunities to grow a lot by merging
theorical knowledges with the real world programming issues and challenges.<br/>
Currently I’m working in the R&amp;D department of my company as with a main role of Machine Learning Engineer.
I love technologies and science in general and I’ve a little bit weird passion for Greco-Roman history and
myths. Yes, you can call me geek or nerd if you prefer. The Love for science and technologies bring me to
continuous working by myself on several ideas and fields. I still collaborate with my Msc thesis supervisor
and reserach mate on some research project principally based on Multiple kernel learning and Deep learning
and NLP techniques.<br/>
By myself I’m also working on big-data, cognitive services and distributed processing, by following some
university courses, working on some project that involves distribuited machine learning for model selection
or hyperparameters selection.<br/>
I’ve good skills in Algorithms and Logic, and I’m used to work in a rapid-change environment with a lot different languages and a large amount of data.
I’m a good and nice person that love to work hard. I’m used to work in teams with different approaches.</p>
